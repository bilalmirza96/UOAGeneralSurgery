# Biliary Disorders

---

## I. Background

Biliary disorders (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis) are some of the more common reasons for Emergency General Surgery consultation and need for operative management.

## II. Guideline

### A. Initial Evaluation with Concern for Biliary Pathology

- **Labs**
    
    * CBC  
    * CMP  
    * Lipase

- **Imaging**
    
    * Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality  
    * CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV Contrast  
        * If diagnostic uncertainty  
        * If concern for severe pancreatitis  
    * HIDA Scan  
        * If concern for acalculous cholecystitis  
        * If diagnostic uncertainty for cholecystitis and high risk for laparoscopic cholecystectomy  
    * MRI/MRCP should be considered only:  
        * When IOC and/or EUS/ERCP are a prohibitive risk  
        * When there is a potential malignancy and MRCP findings will impact management

- **Emergency General Surgery Consultation**
    
    * Patients with gallstone-related disease who will require cholecystectomy should be preferentially admitted to EGS  
    * Patients with prohibitive operative risk factors should be admitted to a medical team  
    * Patients referred for bile duct injury should be evaluated by Hepatobiliary Surgery  
    * Patients with cirrhosis who are listed for liver transplant should be evaluated by Hepatobiliary Surgery

- **Considerations for Gastroenterology (Advanced Endoscopy) Consultation**
    
    * High risk for choledocholithiasis  
    * Postoperative bile leak (see below)

- **Considerations for Radiology (Image-Guided Procedures) Consultation**
    
    * Prohibitive modifiable surgical risk (e.g. recent MI, multisystem organ failure)

### B. Antibiotic Therapy

- **Without Sepsis**
    
    * First Line: Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole  
        * Only need Metronidazole if biliary-enteric anastomosis  
    * Severe PCN allergy: Levofloxacin + Metronidazole  
        * Only need Metronidazole if biliary-enteric anastomosis

- **Sepsis / MDR Risk**
    
    * First Line: Piperacillin/Tazobactam  
    * Severe PCN allergy: Cefepime + Metronidazole + Vancomycin

- **Duration**
    
    * Stop postoperatively if cholecystectomy performed  
    * 4 days if cholecystostomy tube placed

---

### C. Indications for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy

- Cholelithiasis with intractable pain  
- Acute cholecystitis  
- Gallstone pancreatitis  
- Choledocholithiasis

---

### D. Risk Assessment for Choledocholithiasis

- **High Risk**
    
    * Choledocholithiasis identified on imaging  
    * Clinical signs of ascending cholangitis  
    * Total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with CBD dilation on imaging

- **Intermediate Risk**
    
    * Abnormal liver biochemical tests  
    * Dilated CBD (> 6 mm) on imaging

- **Low Risk**
    
    * None of the above risk factors

- **Indication for Intraoperative Cholangiogram**
    
    * Intermediate or high risk for choledocholithiasis

---

### E. Management After Subtotal Cholecystectomy

- Surgical drain placement in gallbladder fossa  
- Evaluate drain for bilious output  
    * If bilious, consult Gastroenterology for ERCP  
    * If nonbilious, discharge patient. Drain management to be determined by rounding attending

---

### F. Special Considerations

- **Prior Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass with possible choledocholithiasis**  
    * Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram  
    * Consider common bile duct exploration vs laparoscopic-assisted ERCP  
    * Coordinate OR timing with GI

- **Gallstone Pancreatitis**  
    * Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy if mild or moderate  
    * Defer cholecystectomy in severe cases

- **Pregnancy**  
    * Symptomatic cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or cholangitis warrants cholecystectomy during hospital admission

---

### G. Management of Postoperative Bile Leaks

- **Early presentation, bilious drain output**
    
    * If low volume and reliable follow-up, consider discharge and expectant management  
    * Otherwise consult GI for ERCP

- **Delayed presentation, no drain in place**
    
    * If noninvasive imaging suggests biloma or drainable fluid collection, consult IR for percutaneous drain prior to ERCP

- **Role of HIDA scan**
    
    * Limited to low- or intermediate-suspicion cases where other diagnostics are equivocal

- **Endoscopic therapy**
    
    * Temporary biliary endoprosthesis with or without biliary sphincterotomy  
    * Plastic stents are appropriate — no strong evidence for metal stents even in subtotal/fenestrated cases

- **If leak persists despite endoscopic therapy**
    
    * Consider source from duct not in continuity (e.g., right posterior sectoral duct)

- **If common bile duct or hepatic duct injury**
    
    * Consult Hepatobiliary Surgery
