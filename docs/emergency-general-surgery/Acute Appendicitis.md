# Acute Appendicitis

## I. Purpose
Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency General Surgery service. This document outlines the management considerations for patients presenting with acute appendicitis.

---

## II. Guideline

### A. Initial Evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**
  - Complete blood count (CBC)
  - Basic metabolic panel (BMP)

- **Imaging**
  - CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

---

### B. Management

#### 1. Antibiotic Therapy

**Recommended durations:**

- Perforated appendicitis with source control: **4-day postoperative course**
- Nonoperative management: **10-day course**
- Appendectomy performed (uncomplicated): **Stop antibiotics postoperatively**

**Regimens:**

- **Without shock**
  - First-line: Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole  
  - Severe penicillin allergy: Levofloxacin + Metronidazole

- **With sepsis or risk for multidrug resistance**
  - First-line: Piperacillin–Tazobactam  
  - Severe penicillin allergy: Vancomycin + Cefepime + Metronidazole

---

#### 2. Additional Management Steps

- Place patient **NPO** pending operative plan
- Obtain Emergency General Surgery consultation and admit to service
- Proceed with laparoscopic appendectomy if operative management is chosen

---

#### 3. Considerations for Nonoperative Management

- Patient preference for nonoperative approach
- Severe inflammation, phlegmon, or perforation on CT requiring ileocecectomy
- High operative or perioperative risk
- Appendicolith on CT (associated with higher recurrence risk)
- Pregnancy: failure of nonoperative management may result in fetal demise
- Age >40 with perforation: consider interval appendectomy due to malignancy risk

---

#### 4. Follow-Up

- **Operative patients**: 7–14 day follow-up (telemedicine or in-person) with pathology review
- **All patients**: Consider colonoscopy referral if colorectal cancer risk factors are present
