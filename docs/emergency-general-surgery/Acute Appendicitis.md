# Acute Appendicitis

### I. Purpose
Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency General Surgery service. This document outlines the management considerations for patients presenting with acute appendicitis.

---

### II. Guideline

#### A. Initial Evaluation
- **Laboratory tests**
  - Complete blood count (CBC)
  - Basic metabolic panel (BMP)
- **Imaging**
  - CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

---

#### B. Management

**1. Antibiotic Therapy**  
_Recommended durations:_
- **Perforated appendicitis with source control**: 4-day postoperative course  
- **Nonoperative management**: 10-day course  
- **Appendectomy performed**: Stop antibiotics postoperatively (if uncomplicated)

- **Without shock**
  - First-line: Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole  
  - Severe penicillin allergy: Levofloxacin + Metronidazole  

- **With sepsis or risk for multidrug resistance**
  - First-line: Piperacillin–Tazobactam  
  - Severe penicillin allergy: Vancomycin + Cefepime + Metronidazole  

---

**2. Additional Management Steps**
- Place patient **NPO** pending operative plan
- Obtain Emergency General Surgery consultation and admit to service
- Proceed with laparoscopic appendectomy if operative management is chosen

---

**3. Considerations for Nonoperative Management**
- Patient preference for nonoperative approach
- Severe inflammation, phlegmon, or perforation on CT scan requiring ileocecectomy
- High operative or perioperative risk profile
- Presence of an appendicolith on CT (associated with higher recurrence risk)
- Pregnancy: failure of nonoperative management can result in fetal demise
- Patients > 40 years with perforated appendicitis: consider interval appendectomy due to increased risk of appendiceal neoplasm

---

**4. Follow-Up**
- **Operative patients**: Follow-up in 7–14 days (via telemedicine or in-person) with review of pathology
- **All patients**: Consider referral for colonoscopy if risk factors for colorectal cancer are present
