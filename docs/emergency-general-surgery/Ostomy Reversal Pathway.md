## Practice Management Guideline: Ostomy Reversal Pathway

---

## Outpatient Management: Colostomy

1. **Postoperative Follow-Up**
    - First visit: 7–14 days post-op OR 2 weeks post-discharge if hospitalized on POD #14  
    - Second visit: 2 months post-op (telehealth if eligible)

2. **Pre-Reversal Workup**
    - If **age >44** and no recent colonoscopy:
        * Order colonoscopy  
        * Barium enema if indicated on discharge checklist
    - If **age <44** or recent colonoscopy:
        * Barium enema if indicated on discharge checklist
    - If **family history** of colon cancer → consider screening colonoscopy  
    - If known or suspected **sphincter injury**:
        * In-person visit with rectal exam  
        * Anal manometry at discretion of attending  
        * If abnormal → refer to Colorectal Surgery
    - Schedule reversal surgery

3. **Preoperative Orders**
    - **Antibiotic Bowel Prep**
        * Neomycin 1g TID the day before surgery (2 PM, 4 PM, 10 PM)  
        * Metronidazole 500 mg TID same schedule  
        * *If neomycin unavailable → use erythromycin 1g TID*
    - **Mechanical Bowel Prep**
        * Magnesium citrate (1–2 bottles) **OR**  
        * Miralax (256 g polyethylene glycol)
    - Chlorhexidine wipes: use the day before surgery  
    - NPO 6 hrs prior to procedure  
    - Clear electrolyte/sports drink immediately before NPO  
    - **Anesthesia**: Perioperative Consultation Service referral for adjunctive analgesia

## Outpatient Management: Ileostomy

1. **Postoperative Follow-Up**
    - First visit: 7–14 days post-op OR 2 weeks post-discharge if hospitalized on POD #14  
    - Second visit: 2 months post-op (telehealth if eligible)

2. **Pre-Reversal Workup**
    - If **age >44** and no recent colonoscopy:
        * Order colonoscopy  
        * Barium enema if indicated on discharge checklist
    - If **age <44** or recent colonoscopy:
        * Barium enema if indicated on discharge checklist
    - If **family history** of colon cancer → consider screening colonoscopy  
    - If known or suspected **sphincter injury**:
        * In-person visit with rectal exam  
        * Anal manometry at discretion of attending  
        * If abnormal → refer to Colorectal Surgery
    - Schedule reversal surgery

3. **Preoperative Orders**
    - *No bowel prep needed*  
    - Chlorhexidine wipes: use the day before surgery  
    - NPO 6 hrs prior to procedure  
    - Clear electrolyte/sports drink immediately before NPO  
    - **Anesthesia**: Perioperative Consultation Service referral for adjunctive analgesia

## Preoperative Risk Optimization

1. **Glycemic Control**
    - If diabetic → check HgbA1c  
    - Consider delaying elective surgery if HgbA1c > 7%  
    - Refer to PMD or Endocrinology for long-term management

2. **Smoking/Nicotine Cessation**
    - Consider referral to Tobacco Quit Line

3. **Anesthesia Referral**
    - VPEC (phone/in-person) → for low periop risk  
    - Hi-Rise → for elevated periop risk

## Discharge Checklist (To Be Completed by Operating Surgeon)

- **Estimated Time to Reversal** (default: 4 months post-colostomy unless specified)  
    * If not a candidate, surgeon must discuss with patient/family

- **Time to First Post-Op Visit** (default: 7–14 days)

- **Time to Second Post-Op Visit** (default: 60 days)

- **Pre-Second Visit Workup**  
    * Patients <44 yrs: No colonoscopy unless strong personal/family history of colon cancer  
    * Colonoscopy 10 years prior to youngest family member’s diagnosis if family history present  
    * Avoid routine barium enema for Hartmann’s procedures at VUMC  
    * All DLI patients require anastomosis evaluation prior to reversal (preferred: barium enema)

- **Hi-RISE or VPEC Referral Needed** (YES / NO)

- **Barriers to Reversal**
    * Smoking  
    * Obesity  
    * Diabetes  
    * Wound healing issues
