# Small Bowel Obstruction

---

## I. Background

Small bowel obstruction remains one of the more common reasons for Emergency General Surgery consultation. Protocolized management has been shown to shorten length of hospital stay and time to operative management.

## II. Guideline

### A. Initial Evaluation with Concern for Bowel Obstruction

- **Labs**
    
    * CBC  
    * BMP  
    * Lactate

- **Imaging**
    
    * CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV Contrast

- **Surgical Evaluation**
    
    * Emergency General Surgery Consultation  
    * If due to gastrointestinal malignancy (known or suspected), consult Surgical Oncology  
    * If Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis), consult Colorectal Surgery  
    * If due to gynecologic malignancy, consult Gynecologic Oncology

- **Admission**
    
    * Patients with bowel obstruction should preferably be admitted to a surgical service

---

### B. Indications for Urgent Exploration

- **Suspected Ischemia**
    
    * Peritonitis on physical examination  
    * Concerning laboratory values  
        * Leukocytosis  
        * Lactic Acidosis  
    * Concerning CT findings  
        * Closed-loop obstruction  
        * Internal hernia  
        * Pneumatosis intestinalis  
        * Mesenteric edema

- **Incarcerated Hernia**

- **No Prior Abdominal Surgery**
    
    * Strongly consider exploration

---

### C. Nonoperative Management – Small Bowel Follow Through

- **Initial Steps**
    
    * Nasogastric decompression for 2 hours  
    * Abdominal X-ray to confirm gastric tube placement

- **Orders**
    
    * `Xray Small Bowel Nonfluoro`  
    * iohexol (OMNIPAQUE) 300 mg/mL, 300 mL  
    * X-rays at 0, 2, 8, 24 hours

- **Interpretation**
    
    * If contrast in the colon **OR** bowel movement within 24 hours → passed small bowel follow through  
    * If no contrast in the colon **AND** no bowel movement within 24 hours → consider exploration

---

### D. Criteria for Discharge

- Tolerating diet without nausea or vomiting  
- Bowel function  
- Resolution of pain
