# Percutaneous Tracheostomy

---

## I. Overview

Patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation are at risk for complications such as pneumonia, tracheomalacia, and subglottic stenosis. Tracheostomy offers a safer and more comfortable long-term airway option. Bedside percutaneous tracheostomy is a safe alternative to open surgical tracheostomy and reduces the need for patient transport and OR resources.

## II. Purpose

- To define indications and contraindications for tracheostomy  
- To describe the accepted protocol for bedside percutaneous tracheostomy

---

## III. Patient Selection

### A. Indications

- Prolonged mechanical ventilation >7 days  
- Inability to protect airway (e.g., AMS, stroke, deconditioning)  
- Structural issues (e.g., severe facial fractures, unresolving airway edema)  
- Consider **early tracheostomy (<7 days)** for:
    * Severe TBI  
    * Cervical spinal cord injury  
    * TBI + submaxillary fractures  
    * Laryngotracheal injury  

### B. Contraindications

- <7 days post-op from anterior cervical fusion  
- High ventilator requirements:
    * FiO₂ > 60%  
    * PEEP > 10  
    * Incompatible with volume control ventilation  
- Elevated ICP  
- Hemodynamic instability

### C. Special Situations

- **High-risk patients**:
    * Morbid obesity  
    * Airway edema  
    * Cervical trauma  
    * Halo brace/MMF  
    * Extremes of age  
    * High ventilator dependence, mucous plugging  
    * Frequent desaturation
    * → Consider bronchoscopy guidance, ENT/OR backup, second proceduralist

- **COVID-19 patients** (must meet all):
    * Cleared from isolation  
    * PEEP <12  
    * FiO₂ <80%  
    * Must be performed by attending

- **BMI ≥ 35** → use **Proximal XLT tracheostomy**

### D. Anticoagulation and Tube Feeds

- **Anticoagulation**
    * Heparin drip: Hold 4 hrs pre- and post-procedure  
    * Prophylactic heparin/enoxaparin: do **not** hold  
    * Therapeutic enoxaparin: Hold AM dose, resume PM if no bleeding  
    * DOACs: Hold 24 hrs pre-, resume PM if no bleeding  
    * Aspirin: Do not hold  
    * Clopidogrel/Ticagrelor/Effient: Do not hold  
    * DAPT: Risk/benefit discussion required

- **Feeds**
    * Hold ≥1 hour prior to procedure  
    * May be held longer at ICU/intensivist discretion

## IV. Procedure

### A. Supplies

1. Portex percutaneous tracheostomy kit (Blue Rhino for XLT)  
2. Mayo scissors (1)  
3. Curved hemostats (3)  
4. Needle holders (2)  
5. Army-Navy retractors (2)  
6. Tracheostomy tubes (#8 Portex + backups)  
7. Sterile towels, gowns, gloves  
8. Chlorhexidine skin prep  
9. 2-0 silk or monofilament sutures (2)  
10. Difficult airway cart/intubation set  
11. CO₂ detector  
12. Towel clamps (2)

### B. Procedure Steps

1. **Sedation**
    * Follow bedside sedation protocol  
    * Recommend chemical paralysis + analgesia

2. **Setup & Timeout**
    * Surgical prep per protocol  
    * Preoperative timeout

3. **Tracheostomy Technique**
    * Infiltrate skin with lidocaine + epinephrine  
    * Make vertical incision 1–2 fingerbreadths above sternal notch  
    * Blunt dissection to trachea in midline  
    * Cut ET tube tape, retract ET tube under direct palpation to cricoid level  
    * Complete tracheostomy via needle access and Seldinger technique

4. **Confirmation**
    * Connect CO₂ monitor and confirm position by color change and exhaled volumes  
    * Withdraw ET tube completely  
    * Secure tracheostomy with sutures and neck strap  
    * Obtain post-procedure chest X-ray

## V. Downsize and Decannulation

### A. Downsize

- **Criteria**
    * > POD 5  
    * Tolerating ≥10 min trach collar trials  
    * No further OR or bronch needs  
    * Off vent & cuff deflation tolerated >48 hrs  
    → Downsize to #6 non-cuffed XLT or #7 Portex

- **Supplies**
    * Airway box and McGrath  
    * Ambu bag, suction  
    * Two new trachs  
    * ETCO₂ detector, 10cc syringe, trach tie, lubricant  
    * Suction catheter

- **Techniques**
    1. **Obturator/fish hook**:  
        * Remove trach → insert obturator with trach → advance at 90° angle → remove obturator → insert inner cannula  
    2. **Seldinger with suction catheter**:  
        * Insert suction catheter through current trach → remove old trach → guide new trach over catheter → confirm ETCO₂ and suction pass

- Document general procedure note

### B. Decannulation

- **Criteria**
    * Off vent >72 hrs  
    * Tolerating PMV or capping  
    * No pending surgery or need for positive pressure  
    * Managing secretions independently  

- **Post-removal Care**
    * Cover stoma with tightly taped dry dressing  
    * Change dressing twice daily
