# Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection

---

## I. Background

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening infection with significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition, initiation of antibiotics, and surgical debridement are essential for effective management.

## II. Guideline

### A. Initial Evaluation

- **Labs**
    * CBC  
    * BMP  
    * Lactate  
    * CRP  
    * Blood cultures

- **Imaging**
    * Diagnosis is primarily clinical and confirmed in the operating room  
    * CT with IV contrast can support diagnosis in equivocal cases  
    * Presence of soft tissue gas is highly specific  
    * Absence of gas does **not** rule out NSTI

- **Initial Antibiotic Therapy**
    * **First-line**: Linezolid + Piperacillin/Tazobactam  
    * **Severe PCN allergy**: Linezolid + Cefepime + Metronidazole

- **Consultations**
    * STAT Emergency General Surgery consultation for trunk NSTI  
    * Additional specialty consults as indicated:
        - Urology (perineal/scrotal NSTI)  
        - Gynecology (vulvar NSTI)  
        - Orthopedics / Hand (extremity NSTI)  
        - Plastic Surgery (for reconstruction after infection control)  
    * Strongly consider SICU admission postoperatively

### B. Surgical Management

- Early, aggressive debridement **within 6 hours**  
- Expedite Level 2 OR activation  
- Send intraoperative specimens for gram stain and culture  
- Use skin-sparing technique when feasible; elevate full-thickness and subcutaneous flaps to access necrotic tissue  
- Debride skin only if necrotic  
- Avoid incisions near bony prominences, major vessels, and nerves  
- Plan for **second look operation within 24 hours** or sooner if patient deteriorates  
- For perineal/perianal involvement: consider **diverting colostomy** once hemodynamically stable  
- For large wounds:
    * Apply **negative pressure wound therapy (VAC)**  
    * Cleanse with **dilute Dakin’s solution** between VAC changes  
- Once stable and debridement complete:
    * Close with interrupted sutures, split-thickness skin grafts, or flaps (Plastic Surgery)

### C. Ongoing Management

- **Antibiotic Duration**
    * Continue systemic antibiotics until ALL of the following:
        - Adequate source control  
        - Hemodynamic normalization  
        - Afebrile for 48 hours  
        - WBC improvement

- **Infectious Disease Consultation**
    * Indications:
        - Multidrug-resistant organisms  
        - Osteoarticular involvement  
        - Per VUMC policy (e.g., S. aureus or Enterococcus bacteremia)

- **Physical & Occupational Therapy**
    * Early involvement recommended
