# Post-Operative Hypoxia and Dyspnea

---

## I. Definition  
- **Hypoxemia:** SpO₂ <92% or PaO₂ <60 mmHg on room air.  
- **Dyspnea:** subjective sensation of breathlessness, often correlating with abnormal oxygenation, ventilation, or increased work of breathing.  
- In the post-op setting, hypoxia/dyspnea may reflect **benign causes (atelectasis, mild hypoventilation)** or **life-threatening complications (PE, pneumonia, ARDS, pneumothorax, anastomotic leak with sepsis).**  

---

## II. Framework  

Think **V–Q–D**:  
- **Ventilation problems:** hypoventilation (opioids, sedation), airway obstruction, OSA, COPD/asthma, atelectasis, pneumothorax.  
- **Perfusion problems:** PE, right heart dysfunction, hypovolemia/shock.  
- **Diffusion problems:** pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS.

## III. Stepwise Evaluation  

### Step 1 – Confirm & Assess Stability  
- Recheck SpO₂, correlate with waveform.  
- Vital signs: RR, HR, BP, O₂ sat, temp.  
- If SpO₂ <92% or acute distress → **see patient immediately**.  
- Assess airway patency, mental status, work of breathing.  

### Step 2 – Focused History  
- New chest pain, pleuritic pain, cough, sputum, hemoptysis.  
- Timing: immediate post-op (residual anesthesia, aspiration) vs later (pneumonia, PE).  
- Risk factors: immobility, OSA, COPD, obesity, smoking, prior PE/DVT, major surgery.  

### Step 3 – Focused Exam  
- Airway: obstruction, stridor, snoring.  
- Chest: breath sounds (wheezing, crackles, absent breath sounds, asymmetry).  
- CV: tachycardia, JVD, edema, new murmur.  
- Abdomen: distension → splinting, aspiration risk.  
- Extremities: swelling/asymmetry → possible DVT/PE.  

### Step 4 – Initial Workup  
- Pulse oximetry (continuous if unstable).  
- ABG (if altered, severe distress, or rising CO₂ suspected).  
- CXR: atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, effusion, PTX.  
- ECG ± troponin: rule out ACS.  
- Labs: CBC (infection), BMP, BNP if heart failure suspected.  
- Consider CTA chest (PE protocol) if hypoxemia unexplained and risk factors present.  
- Bedside echo/POCUS: RV strain (PE), LV dysfunction, effusion, B-lines (pulmonary edema).

## IV. Management  

### Immediate Stabilization  
- Ensure airway, give supplemental O₂ (nasal cannula → non-rebreather → HFNC/BiPAP → intubation if needed).  
- Sit patient upright, encourage incentive spirometry, deep breathing.  
- Call senior early if SpO₂ <90% despite O₂ or increased work of breathing.  

### Treat Underlying Cause  
- **Ventilation:**  
  - Opioid/sedative depression → reduce meds, consider naloxone.  
  - Atelectasis → IS, ambulation, CPAP/HFNC.  
  - Bronchospasm (COPD/asthma) → albuterol nebs, steroids if severe.  
  - Pneumothorax → chest tube if large/symptomatic.  

- **Perfusion:**  
  - Suspected PE → CTA chest, anticoagulation if stable, escalate if unstable.  
  - Shock/hypovolemia → fluids, blood, pressors as indicated.  

- **Diffusion:**  
  - Pneumonia → cultures, empiric antibiotics.  
  - Pulmonary edema → diuretics, NIPPV, afterload reduction if hypertensive.  
  - ARDS → lung-protective ventilation, ICU transfer.

## V. Red Flags – Call Senior/ICU Immediately  
- SpO₂ <88% or persistent <92% on supplemental O₂.  
- Increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, altered mental status.  
- Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, shock).  
- Suspected PE with instability.  
- New large pneumothorax, tension physiology.  
- Post-op patient requiring **escalation to BiPAP/HFNC or intubation**.  

---

## VI. Intern Pearls  
- Always think **atelectasis vs pneumonia vs PE** in post-op hypoxia.  
- Don’t forget **opioid/sedation-induced hypoventilation** early post-op.  
- If unilateral decreased breath sounds post central line → rule out pneumothorax.  
- Incentive spirometry and early ambulation are the best prevention.  
- Hypoxia + tachycardia out of proportion to exam = **PE until proven otherwise.**

## Key Takeaways  
- **Hypoxia <92% = evaluate immediately.**  
- Use **V–Q–D** framework: Ventilation, Perfusion, Diffusion.  
- Always stabilize first (airway, O₂, positioning).  
- Treat underlying cause: atelectasis, pneumonia, PE, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax.  
- Call senior early for persistent hypoxemia, distress, or instability.
