# Post-Operative Hypoxia and Dyspnea

---

## I. Definition

* **Hypoxemia:** SpO₂ <92% or PaO₂ <60 mmHg on room air.
* **Dyspnea:** subjective sensation of breathlessness, often correlating with abnormal oxygenation, ventilation, or increased work of breathing.
* In the post-op setting, hypoxia/dyspnea may reflect **benign causes (atelectasis, mild hypoventilation)** or **life-threatening complications (PE, pneumonia, ARDS, pneumothorax, anastomotic leak with sepsis).**

---

## II. Framework

Think **V–Q–D**:

* **Ventilation problems:** hypoventilation (opioids, sedation), airway obstruction, OSA, COPD/asthma, atelectasis, pneumothorax.
* **Perfusion problems:** PE, right heart dysfunction, hypovolemia/shock.
* **Diffusion problems:** pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS.

## III. Stepwise Evaluation

### Step 1 – Confirm & Assess Stability

* Recheck SpO₂, correlate with waveform.
* Vital signs: RR, HR, BP, O₂ sat, temp.
* If SpO₂ <92% or acute distress → **see patient immediately**.
* Assess airway patency, mental status, work of breathing.

### Step 2 – Focused History

* New chest pain, pleuritic pain, cough, sputum, hemoptysis.
* Timing: immediate post-op (residual anesthesia, aspiration) vs later (pneumonia, PE).
* Risk factors: immobility, OSA, COPD, obesity, smoking, prior PE/DVT, major surgery.

### Step 3 – Focused Exam

* Airway: obstruction, stridor, snoring.
* Chest: breath sounds (wheezing, crackles, absent breath sounds, asymmetry).
* CV: tachycardia, JVD, edema, new murmur.
* Abdomen: distension → splinting, aspiration risk.
* Extremities: swelling/asymmetry → possible DVT/PE.

### Step 4 – Initial Workup

* Pulse oximetry (continuous if unstable).
* ABG (if altered, severe distress, or rising CO₂ suspected).
* CXR: atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, effusion, PTX.
* ECG ± troponin: rule out ACS.
* Labs: CBC (infection), BMP, BNP if heart failure suspected.
* Consider CTA chest (PE protocol) if hypoxemia unexplained and risk factors present.
* Bedside echo/POCUS: RV strain (PE), LV dysfunction, effusion, B-lines (pulmonary edema).

## IV. Management

### Immediate Stabilization

* Ensure airway, give supplemental O₂ (nasal cannula → non-rebreather → HFNC/BiPAP → intubation if needed).
* Sit patient upright, encourage incentive spirometry, deep breathing.
* Call senior early if SpO₂ <90% despite O₂ or increased work of breathing.

### Treat Underlying Cause

* **Ventilation:**

  * Opioid/sedative depression → reduce meds, consider naloxone.
  * Atelectasis → IS, ambulation, CPAP/HFNC.
  * Bronchospasm (COPD/asthma) → albuterol nebs, steroids if severe.
  * Pneumothorax → chest tube if large/symptomatic.

* **Perfusion:**

  * Suspected PE → CTA chest, anticoagulation if stable, escalate if unstable.
  * Shock/hypovolemia → fluids, blood, pressors as indicated.

* **Diffusion:**

  * Pneumonia → cultures, empiric antibiotics.
  * Pulmonary edema → diuretics, NIPPV, afterload reduction if hypertensive.
  * ARDS → lung-protective ventilation, ICU transfer.

## V. Oxygen Delivery Devices – Summary Table


| Device | Usage | Flow Rate | Delivered FiO₂ | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **Simple Face Mask** | Moderate-to-severe hypoxia, initial treatment | 5–10 L/min (≥5 to flush CO₂) | 35–50% | Higher FiO₂ than NC, easy to use | Dry mucosa (needs humidification), interferes with eating/talking |
| **Reservoir Cannula (Oxymizer)** | Chronic or ambulatory use, higher FiO₂ without high flow | Up to 16 L/min | Up to 90% | Conserves O₂, higher delivery efficiency, mustache/pendant styles | Bulky, cosmetic concerns |
| **Partial Rebreather Mask** | Moderate-to-severe hypoxia | 6–10 L/min (bag must not collapse) | 50–70% | Higher FiO₂ than simple mask | Bag monitoring required, interferes with ADLs |
| **Non-Rebreather Mask** | Acute, severe hypoxia | 10–15 L/min (≥10 to keep bag inflated) | 85–90% | Very high FiO₂ delivery | Interferes with ADLs, risk of CO₂ retention if inadequate flow |
| **Double Trunk Mask** | Patients with high inspiratory flow demand | Same as NC (low/high flow) | Up to 100% | Improves PaO₂ compared to NC alone | Requires assembly, cumbersome |
| **Venturi Mask** | Precise FiO₂ delivery in moderate-to-severe hypoxia | 2–15 L/min (depends on adapter color) | 24–60% | Fixed, accurate FiO₂ | Bulky, less accurate at high FiO₂, interferes with ADLs |
| **High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)** | Severe hypoxia, step before NIV/intubation | 10–60 L/min | Up to 100% | Heated, humidified, comfortable, provides mild PEEP | Requires equipment, cannula may be uncomfortable |
| **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)** | OSA, pulmonary edema | Device-dependent | 21–100% | Keeps airway open, reduces preload/afterload | Requires tight mask, poorly tolerated in some |
| **Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)** | Hypercarbia (COPD, ARDS), avoids intubation | Device-dependent | 21–100% | Inspiratory/expiratory pressure support | Risk of aspiration, requires cooperation |
| **Invasive Mechanical Ventilation** | Severe/critical hypoxia, perioperative support | Device-dependent | 21–100% with PEEP | Precise control of FiO₂, tidal volume, PEEP | Requires intubation, sedation, ICU-level support |


## VI. Red Flags – Call Senior/ICU Immediately

* SpO₂ <88% or persistent <92% on supplemental O₂.
* Increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, altered mental status.
* Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, shock).
* Suspected PE with instability.
* New large pneumothorax, tension physiology.
* Post-op patient requiring **escalation to BiPAP/HFNC or intubation**.

---

## VII. Intern Pearls

* Always think **atelectasis vs pneumonia vs PE** in post-op hypoxia.
* Don’t forget **opioid/sedation-induced hypoventilation** early post-op.
* If unilateral decreased breath sounds post central line → rule out pneumothorax.
* Incentive spirometry and early ambulation are the best prevention.
* Hypoxia + tachycardia out of proportion to exam = **PE until proven otherwise.**

## Key Takeaways

* **Hypoxia <92% = evaluate immediately.**
* Use **V–Q–D** framework: Ventilation, Perfusion, Diffusion.
* Always stabilize first (airway, O₂, positioning).
* Escalate oxygen devices stepwise (NC → mask → NRB → HFNC → NIV → intubation).
* Call senior early for persistent hypoxemia, distress, or instability.
