# Post-Operative Hypotension Management Guideline  

---

## I. Definition  
- **Hypotension = SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg**, or a drop > 40 mmHg from baseline.  
- Clinical significance is based on **organ perfusion**: altered mental status, oliguria, lactic acidosis, or chest pain indicate poor perfusion regardless of numeric threshold.  

---

## II. Principles  
- Post-operative hypotension may be **benign (residual anesthesia, mild hypovolemia)** or **life-threatening (hemorrhage, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, anaphylaxis)**.  
- Think in categories:  
  - **Tank (volume problem)**: hypovolemia, hemorrhage, third spacing.  
  - **Pump (cardiac problem)**: MI, arrhythmia, tamponade, cardiomyopathy, PE.  
  - **Pipes (systemic vascular resistance problem)**: sepsis, anaphylaxis, adrenal insufficiency, neurogenic/epidural vasodilation.  
- **Unstable patient with hypotension = shock until proven otherwise.**

## III. Stepwise Evaluation  

### Step 1 – Confirm  
- Recheck BP manually, ensure cuff size appropriate.  
- Review trend and correlate with HR, SpO₂, urine output.  

### Step 2 – Assess Stability  
- ABCs first.  
- Mental status, urine output, capillary refill, extremity temperature.  
- If unstable: call senior/ICU, begin resuscitation.  

### Step 3 – History & Exam  
- **History:** operative blood loss, fluid replacement, meds (antihypertensives, epidural).  
- **Exam:**  
  - Surgical site, drains, dressings (bleeding, hematoma).  
  - JVP, lung sounds, heart sounds (CHF, tamponade).  
  - Abdomen (distension, rigidity, leak).  
  - Extremities (warm vs cool, mottling).  

### Step 4 – Immediate Workup  
- Vitals with continuous monitoring.  
- CBC (hemoglobin/hematocrit).  
- BMP (electrolytes, renal function).  
- Lactate (tissue perfusion).  
- Coagulation studies if bleeding suspected.  
- ECG (ischemia, arrhythmia).  
- CXR (pneumothorax, pulmonary edema).  
- Consider: bedside echocardiography/POCUS for volume status, cardiac function, tamponade.  
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis if intra-abdominal bleeding/leak suspected and patient is stable enough.

## IV. Management  

### General Principles  
- **Airway, Breathing, Circulation** first.  
- Place 2 large-bore IVs (14–16g), O₂, monitor.  
- Type & crossmatch if bleeding suspected.  

### Stepwise Approach  

1. **Tank (Hypovolemia / Hemorrhage / Third Spacing)**  
   - IV fluid bolus: 500–1000 mL crystalloid.  
   - Reassess response.  
   - If inadequate: repeat bolus, consider blood products.  
   - Look for bleeding: surgical site, drains, chest/abdomen.  

2. **Pump (Cardiac dysfunction)**  
   - EKG, troponin → MI?  
   - Arrhythmia → treat per ACLS (AFib, VT, VF, bradycardia).  
   - Consider bedside echo for function.  
   - If cardiogenic shock → inotropes (dobutamine), cardiology consult.  

3. **Pipes (Vasodilation / Maldistribution)**  
   - Sepsis → cultures, broad antibiotics, source control, fluids.  
   - Anaphylaxis → epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines.  
   - Adrenal insufficiency → stress-dose hydrocortisone.  
   - Epidural-induced vasodilation → fluids, reduce/stop epidural infusion, vasopressors.  

4. **If persistent hypotension despite fluids**  
   - Start vasopressors: norepinephrine (first-line).  
   - ICU transfer for vasopressor support and advanced monitoring.

## V. Red Flags – Call Senior Immediately  
- Hypotension unresponsive to 1–2 L crystalloid.  
- Suspected active bleeding or falling H/H.  
- Hypotension with chest pain, arrhythmia, or new ST changes.  
- Hypotension with hypoxia, respiratory distress (possible PE, tamponade, pneumothorax).  
- Hypotension in septic patient with altered mental status or lactic acidosis.  

---

## VI. Intern Pearls  
- **Hypotension is never normal post-op** → always search for a cause.  
- **Tank, Pump, Pipes** framework keeps differential organized.  
- Look at **HR response**:  
  - Tachycardia → volume loss, sepsis.  
  - Bradycardia → conduction block, meds, high vagal tone.  
- **Response to fluids is diagnostic** — improvement suggests volume issue.  
- Persistent hypotension despite fluids = **ICU + pressors**.  
- Never forget **occult bleeding** — retroperitoneal, intra-abdominal, hemothorax.

## Key Takeaways  
- **Define hypotension clinically: MAP < 65 or SBP < 90 with signs of hypoperfusion.**  
- Think **Tank, Pump, Pipes** for causes.  
- **Stepwise: Confirm → Assess stability → Focused exam → Workup → Resuscitate.**  
- **Unstable = shock until proven otherwise.**  
- Early senior involvement is critical — hypotension is never benign in surgical patients.
