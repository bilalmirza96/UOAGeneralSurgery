# Post-Operative Fever  

---

## I. Principles  
- **Fever = temperature > 38.0°C (100.4°F)** in the immediate post-operative setting.  
- May be **benign (inflammatory response, blood products)** or **pathologic (infection, thromboembolic, ischemic)**.  
- Always stratify by **time since surgery**, **severity**, and **patient stability**.  
- **Unstable patient with fever = sepsis until proven otherwise.**

## II. Timeline-Based Differential  

| Post-Op Timing | Common Etiologies | High-Risk / Dangerous Causes |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| < 48 hours | Inflammatory response, hematoma, aspiration, transfusion reaction, atelectasis | Early pneumonia, intra-op contamination, line infection |
| 48–72 hours | Pneumonia, UTI, phlebitis, catheter infection | Anastomotic leak, sepsis |
| 3–7 days | Surgical site infection, pneumonia, UTI, C. difficile colitis | Intra-abdominal abscess, anastomotic leak, empyema |
| > 7 days | DVT/PE, line sepsis, drug fever | Deep abscess, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis |

## III. Stepwise Evaluation  

### Step 1 – Confirm Fever  
- Verify measurement and source, repeat if uncertain.  
- Review trend, maximum temperature, and fever pattern (isolated vs persistent vs spiking).  

### Step 2 – Assess Stability  
- **Vitals:** HR, BP, O2 sat, RR.  
- **Sepsis screen:** hypotension, tachypnea, altered mental status, oliguria.  

### Step 3 – History and Exam  
- **History:** cough, sputum, dysuria, wound pain/drainage, diarrhea, calf pain/swelling, meds/blood products.  
- **Exam:** chest, surgical wounds, drains, Foley, IV/central lines, extremities.  

### Step 4 – Initial Workup  
- **Basic set (almost always):**  
  - CBC with differential  
  - BMP  
  - Blood cultures ×2  
  - Urinalysis ± urine culture  
  - Chest X-ray  
- **Targeted testing (if indicated):**  
  - Sputum culture (productive cough)  
  - Stool toxin/PCR (diarrhea, recent antibiotics)  
  - CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (abdominal tenderness, tachycardia, leak/abscess concern)  
  - Duplex ultrasound (suspected DVT)  
  - Line cultures (if catheter infection suspected)

## IV. Management  

- **Stable patients**  
  - Complete evaluation before empiric antibiotics  
  - Supportive care: antipyretics, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry, ambulation, hydration  

- **Unstable patients**  
  - Treat as sepsis  
  - Cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids  
  - Search for and initiate source control (abscess drainage, remove infected line, debride wound)  

- **Source-directed therapy**  
  - Abscess → drainage  
  - SSI → open wound, culture, drainage  
  - Pneumonia/UTI → targeted antibiotics  
  - C. difficile → oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin  
  - Line sepsis → line removal  

---

## V. Red Flags – Call Senior Immediately  
- Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia)  
- Peritonitis or rigid abdomen  
- Fever with chest pain, arrhythmia, or sudden hypoxia (possible PE/MI)  
- Purulent, feculent, or bilious drainage from wound or drains  
- Temperature > 39°C without clear source  

---

## VI. Intern Pearls  
- **First 24h fevers** often non-infectious, but rule out aspiration, transfusion reaction, necrotizing infection.  
- Always inspect lines, drains, Foley, wounds.  
- **Drug fever** is rare and a diagnosis of exclusion.  
- Remember: **Sepsis = Source control + Antibiotics + Resuscitation.**

## VII. Quick Reference Table  

### Initial Workup  

| Test | Indication |
|------|------------|
| CBC with diff | Almost always |
| BMP | Baseline and renal function |
| Blood cultures ×2 | Unexplained fever or unstable |
| Urinalysis ± UCx | Foley or dysuria |
| Chest X-ray | POD >2, cough, hypoxia |
| CT A/P with IV contrast | Abdominal tenderness, leak/abscess concern |
| Duplex US | Suspected DVT |
| Stool toxin/PCR | Diarrhea, recent antibiotics |
| Line cultures | Suspected line sepsis |

## Key Takeaways  
- Always **verify fever, assess stability, and apply timeline-based differential**.  
- Early fevers often benign; late fevers usually infectious.  
- Workup should be **systematic and source-driven**.  
- **Unstable post-op patient with fever = treat as sepsis until proven otherwise.**
