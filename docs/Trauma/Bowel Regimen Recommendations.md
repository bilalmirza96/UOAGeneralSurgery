- **Sennokot:** Stimulant laxative  
- **Milk of Magnesia:** Osmotic laxative  
- **Bisacodyl suppository:** Stimulant laxative  
- **Lactulose:** Osmotic laxative

## Initial Regimen (All patients on admission)

* **START:**  
  * Sennokot 2 tablets BID  
  * AND Miralax 17 g daily  

---

## If No Bowel Movement (BM) within 48 Hours of Starting Regimen

### Normal Renal Function

* **ADD** Milk of Magnesia 15 mL PO TID

### Impaired Renal Function

* **ADD** Lactulose 20 g PO TID

---

## If No BM within 72 Hours of Starting Regimen

### Normal Renal Function

* **INCREASE** Milk of Magnesia to 30 mL PO TID  
* **ADD** Bisacodyl suppository 10 mg PR ×1

### Impaired Renal Function

* **ADD** Bisacodyl suppository 10 mg PR ×1

---

## If No BM within 96 Hours of Starting Regimen

* **ADD** SMOG enema 120 mL PR ×1  
* **CONSIDER** KUB

---

## Monitor Physical Exam

**Obtain KUB to assess for ileus or obstruction if any of the following symptoms are present:**

* Increased abdominal distention, discomfort, or firmness  
* Decreased or minimal flatus  
* Increased belching or hiccupping  
* Nausea or vomiting

# Bowel Regimen for **Non-Functioning GI Tract**

> If an ileus is present based on clinical presentation or imaging:

* Place NG tube to low wall suction and monitor output  
* Make patient NPO  
* Initiate maintenance IV fluids  
* Monitor electrolytes as needed  
* Continue per rectal bowel regimen  
* Encourage ambulation if appropriate  
* KUB as needed to monitor bowel gas pattern  
* Discontinue or limit offending medications:
  * Opioids
  * Anticholinergics
  * Dopamine agonists
  * Anti-serotonergics

---

### Consider Pharmacologic Interventions

**If Ogilvie’s Syndrome on imaging:**

* Consider **neostigmine** (can only be administered on 10N)  
  * **Use caution in patients with an anastomosis**

**For postoperative ileus or opioid-induced constipation:**

* **Oral Naloxone**
  * Initial dose: 2 mg PO TID
  * Max dose: 4 mg PO TID
  * Max total duration: 48 hours
  * Monitor for opioid reversal, especially in liver disease

* **Methylnaltrexone** 12 mg SQ ×1
  * For patients who failed oral naloxone and **no obstruction on imaging**
  * May repeat one dose after 24 hours if no resolution
  * **Discuss with attending physician before ordering**
  * **Use caution in patients with an anastomosis**

---

## Recommendations for Diarrhea

* **Stop** bowel regimen  
* **Monitor** electrolytes  

### If C. difficile negative:

* **Imodium** 4 mg q6h PRN  
* **Fiber Supplementation:**
  * No feeding tube:  
    * Psyllium 2 caps daily (max 5 caps QID)
  * With feeding tube:  
    * Nutrisource fiber – 1 packet daily (max 6 packets/day; found in tube feed order)
  * Increase dose and frequency as needed
