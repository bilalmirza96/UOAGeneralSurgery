## contributing
### getting access
Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). It's free. Then shoot an email with your username to one of the maintainers of the vimbook (e.g. beau.hilton@vumc.org) to be added to the organization.
### finding the files and opening them for editing
On each page on [vimbook.org](vgs-book) there is a small pencil icon in the top right. If you are logged into GitHub, have been granted editing access, and click this button, it will take you right to a file editor for that page. Alternatively, if you are already here on GitHub, the working files are in folders in the [docs directory](https://github.com/bilalmirza96/VanderbiltGeneralSurgery/vimbook/tree/main/docs). Click into the folder you want, then into the file you want, and click the pencil icon above and to the right of the text.
### editing basics
The website is written in a simple text format called "Markdown," and you can edit the files right here on GitHub.

> Markdown is a very simple text format that closely resembles the formatting we tend to use in medical documentation. E.g. a single '#' is used to denote a top-level header, multiple '##' denote sub-headings, '-' are used to denote list items (put a blank line before you start a new list, or markdown will think you're just putting a hyphen into a sentence), '*' around things mark them as important. The tool that builds the website will convert this markup into prettier and uniform styles, so you don't have to worry about getting the indentation or font just right.
